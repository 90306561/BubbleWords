# BubbleWords

This was my first app that I developed with a team. The game uses a bubble shooter style shooter and releases a ball that hits one of 30 
randomly spawned letters. The goal is to spell out a word, click the check, and then the app checks to see if it's a word, and then adds 
the respective scrabble letter values to your score. The hardest part of developing this app was to find a way to include the dictionary
to check and see if the inputted word was really a word.
